             <p>
            I received my BSc degree in Electronics Engineering (Telecommunication netwworks) in 2018, at the University Gamal Abdel Nasser of Conakry, Guinea. I am currently pursuing a master's degree 
			in Electrical Engineering (Telecommunication option) at PAUSTI,where I am conducting a research in Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas for 5G milimeter-Wave communication systems. 
			This research activity is equiping me with both theoritical and practical knowledge on Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) design for devices such as microstrip antennas. I recently simulated a circular 
			microstrip antenna that has a dual-band functionality for 5G applications. The design was accomplished using Rogers 5880 duroid PCB material. The material has a permittivity constant of 2.2, a tangent
			loss of 0.0009, and a thickness of 1.575mm. The simulation was carried on using Ansys-HFSS 2021R1, which a commerically available high frequency structure simulator. 
            In addition, I have a background in Computer networking and in telecommunication networks. Considering the above descriptions, my area of experty in the "ROBOTIC DOJO Program" will be mainly include PCB 
           design and networking.

			 <h2> <b>My expectations for the DOJO-Robotic Program </b></h2>
             <p>
               At the end of the "ROBOTIC DOJO PROGRAM", I expect to acquire a strong foundation on modeling and implementing a Robot that can perform a specific task or solve a real life problem. I also expect to apply the the
			   theoretical knowledge related to PCB design and networking for solving practical problems to impact the society.
